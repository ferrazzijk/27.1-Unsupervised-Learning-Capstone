# **Segmenting Illinois Schools by 5 Essentials Climate Survey Data**

The data provided is provided compliments of the Illinois State Board of Education. We are examining the Illinois 5-Essentials Survey Restults for the 18-19 school year and training a model to group schools by similarity. 


**What are the 5Essentials and 5Essentials Survey?**

5Essentials is an evidence-based system designed to drive improvement in schools nationwide—it reliably measures changes in a school organization through the 5Essentials Survey and provides individualized, actionable Reports for each school. The 5Essentials system is based on more than 20 years of research by the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research on five components found to be critical for school success:

*   **Effective Leaders:** The principal works with teachers to implement a clear and strategic vision for school success.
*   **Collaborative Teachers:** Teachers collaborate to promote professional growth.
*   **Involved Families:** The entire school staff builds strong relationships with families and communities to support learning.
*   **Supportive Environment:** The school is safe and orderly. Teachers have high expectations for students and support students to realize their goals. Classmates also support one another.
*  **Ambitious Instruction:** Classes are academically demanding and engage students by emphasizing the application of knowledge.

The data set was chosen out of direct personal relation with it. I was a teacher at a school in the data set, A. Vito Martinez Middle School, from the 2011-2012 school year through the 2018-2019 school year.
